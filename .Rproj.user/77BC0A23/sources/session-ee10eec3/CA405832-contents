### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
nobel <- read_csv("data/nobel.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
```{r knowdata}
nobel %>% 
  print()
```

935 observations - each row represents a different person

### Exercise 2

```{r}
nobel_living <- nobel %>%
  filter(!is.na(country), gender != "org", is.na(died_date))
```

### Exercise 3

```{r mutate}
nobel_living <- nobel_living %>%
  mutate(
    country_us = if_else(country == "USA", "USA", "Other")
  )
```

```{r excludeecon}
nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Physics", "Medicine", "Chemistry", "Economics"))
```

```{r plot}
ggplot(nobel_living_science, aes(x = category, fill = country_us)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Category of Prize by Country", x = "Category of Prize", y = "Count") + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~ category)  
```
  - The majority of econ winners are from the US  
  - Roughly 1/2 of the chem winners are from the US
  - About 2/3 of the medicine winners are from the US 
  - A little over 1/2 of chemistry winners are from the US
  
These results are similar to the graphs presented by BuzzFeed claiming most nobel laureates were based in the US when they one there prize 
  

### Exercise 4

```{r borncountry}
nobel_born_count <- nobel_living_science %>%
  mutate(
    born_country_us = if_else(born_country == "USA", "USA", "Other")
  )
```

```{r}
glimpse(nobel_born_count)
```
```{r}
nobel_born_count %>%  
  count(born_country_us)
```
105/228 winners were born in the US 


### Exercise 5

```{r}
ggplot(nobel_born_count, aes(x = country_us, fill = born_country_us)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") + 
  labs(title = "Category of Prize by Country", subtitle = "By Country of Birth", x = "Won in US or Not", y = "Count") + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~ category)
  
```

Key results:  
- many of the nobel laureate winners were in the US when they won the award, but were born outside of the US  
- winners of categories such as econ tend to be US-born where as physics tend to be internationally born   
- results appear to support the BuzzFeed article's claim that immigration is important to since because many nobel laureates are not US-born 

### Exercise 6

```{r}
nobel_born_count %>% 
  filter(born_country_us == "Other") %>%
  count(born_country)%>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 

```

Germany is the most common country (20 award winners)
